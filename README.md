Bobby Might Remove the DiRectory.

> NOTE: This is a very dangerous program. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Don't run it if you don't know what you are doing. You have been warned.

Now, here is what it does.

Removes a directory from your filesystem after a specified duration. It may create the directory if one doesn't exist.
The expressions for the time are the ones supported by Go's [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "¬µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". 

## Usage

Again, don't use this if you don't know what you are doing or aren't sure. There are no safeguards. I am not responsible for any data loss or corruption. ‚ö†Ô∏è

```sh
$ bobbymrdr -d "new-project-directory" -r "5m" 
```


## Why?

I wanted to write some code that does something dangerous. üòé
